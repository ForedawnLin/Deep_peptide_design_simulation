# Design of peptide inhibitors targeting Î²-catenin using generative deep learning and molecular dynamics simulations

We host our code and data publicly on Code Ocean, you will find complete code, data, readme file and the environment setting there. You can also try a reproducile run to get the peptide sampling results.
